This is my attempt at following the intro to image in go from the [pheelicks.com] (http://www.pheelicks.com/) blog

intro
======

I was looking to learn Golang for some times. I am running a Ubuntu 13.10 with Golang 1.2 installed.
I went through several attempt to install Golang properly. Eventually I came accross [gvm] (https://github.com/moovweb/gvm) which by far the easiest and noob friendly solution.

basics
======

to run the examples in this section:

blank
------------------------
```
go run blank.go
```

gradient
------------------------
```
go run gradient.go
```

canvas version
------------------------
```
go run main.go canvas.go
```
